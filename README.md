##Drupal Coding Standards Sniffer for PTI

More info about this "Project": [http://drupal.org/node/897116](http://drupal.org/node/897116)

####Requirements:
[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org)  
[Eclipse PTI - Php Tools Integration](http://drupal.org/node/897116)

####Installation:
- [Install Eclipse](http://drupal.org/node/75242)
- Install PTI Plugin
- Configure PTI:
  - Open Eclipse preferences -> PHP Tools -> PHP Codesniffer:
    - Add a new "CodeSniffer Standard" - choose this library
    - Activate the library by checking the checkbox next to its name.
    - Make sure the Standard Tab Width configuration is set to 0. Otherwise you won't get notified about evil tabs in the code.
    
Now you'll have a PHP Tools entry in the right click menu in the navigator. 
Or you can just hit "Validate" within the right click menu of a file.

####Recommendation:
- Disable the autorun of validators to save performance.
- Configure the "CodeSniffer Standard" to use per project.

####Attention:
This is still a draft!!

[http://drupal.org/project/coder](http://drupal.org/project/coder) if the validation is correct
